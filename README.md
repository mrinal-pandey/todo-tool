# todo-tool
A Bash shell tool used to manage your daily todo tasks using command line!

I use this script to manage my todo tasks on command line, if you wish to do the same
1. Clone this repository
2. Add the following line to your `.bashrc` file `alias todo='/path/to/todo'`

You're good to go!
Run `todo --help` to see all the options available for the tool.
